Overview:
This project aims to develop a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network that enables users to communicate, share files, or perform distributed computing tasks without relying on a centralized server. The P2P architecture ensures decentralization, scalability, and efficiency in data transmission and resource sharing.

Features:
Decentralized Network: Direct peer-to-peer connections without a central authority.
Secure Data Transfer: Encryption techniques ensure privacy and data integrity.
Efficient Resource Sharing: Optimized routing and load balancing for improved performance.
Fault Tolerance: Nodes can dynamically join and leave the network without disrupting operations.
Cross-Platform Support: Compatible with multiple operating systems and devices.

Technologies Used:
Programming Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React,TypeScript).
Networking Protocols: WebRTC.
Authentication: OAuth 2.0
Database: MySQL.
Backend: Node.js.
Hosting: Firebase.
